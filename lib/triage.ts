/**
 * Denial triage: the deterministic part of what Yeam knows.
 *
 * This is rules, not AI, and that is the point. Deciding whether a denial wants
 * a corrected claim, a reprocessing request or an appeal — and how many days are
 * left to send it — is a lookup against the payer's own rules. No model call, no
 * network, no server. Which means it can run in the visitor's browser on their
 * real denials, and their file never leaves the machine.
 *
 * That property is the whole product argument. A general chat model will write a
 * competent appeal letter for one denial. It will not tell you that the CO-11
 * sitting next to it must NOT be appealed — it needs a corrected claim, and
 * appealing it burns the filing window on a coding error. It will not hold 143
 * deadlines. And you cannot paste an EOB into it without breaching HIPAA.
 *
 * Scope note: this is the public subset — the common codes and generic filing
 * windows. Payer-specific profiles, drafting and the win-rate feedback loop stay
 * server-side.
